                Does she like frolicking through the meadow and soft fuzzy things?

                The cumulus cloud is perfect for her. They often resemble floating pieces of cotton and look like the perfect place to take a nap. Be careful though, these snuggly little guys can rise up and develop into a giant comulonimbus, a storm cloud. No refunds.

                Does she have beautiful bouncing hair?

                Look no further, the cirrus cloud is perfect for her. Stemming from the Latin work cirrus meaning curling lock of hair, she is guaranteed to take this gift as a compliment to her magnificent ringlets. This cloud often warns us of incoming tropical cyclones, so she will definitely be able to say I told you so! If you happen to get caught in a cyclone trying to show it to her…. No refunds.

                Does her personality shine super bright?

                A flashy cloud might be too much going on, if so, the stratus cloud is for her. This cloud doesn’t have very many features, often described as flat and hazy. This is the perfect cloud, as it won’t get in her way, or distract from the brilliance that is her. These clouds may produce a light drizzle, or small amount of snow. No refunds.

                Trying to heat things up in the bedroom? Up your motorboat game?

                Do we have the cloud for you. The mammatus cloud, named after the latin word mamma, meaning breast, is a great, in your face gift. You’ll have never wanted to motorboat a cloud so badly. These clouds are easily spotted in the sky and definitely shift your thinking towards the bedroom. Aviators see these clouds and know they are in for a bumpy ride. These clouds are also know to attaching to the bottom of other clouds, if you know what I mean. It is rare the sky stays clear with these guys around. If they are… no refunds.

                Does she take your breath away? Confuse the shit out of you? Make you homicidal?

                Well good sir, the tornado is what you want. These beautiful yet terrifying creatures come in, and boy do they leave their mark. This beaut is a destructive vortex of violently rotating winds. The tornado is an upgrade from the mammatus, make sure you are ready for this one. You might get yanked back and forth a few times, but who doesn’t like a little chaos every now and then? The tornado is also great to send to the occasional ex. When not prepared to encounter a one of these puppies, they can a a hell of revenge! Trust me, you won’t even ask about a refund on this one. No refunds.
